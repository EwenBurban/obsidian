- [ ] change prior of beta shape parameter to [0.1,10]
- [ ] Add N_ref value in config.yaml
- [ ] allow RIDGE to run with diploid dataset
- [ ] Allow to subsample in an other way than 100 locus per chr (need to work with contigs)
- [ ] change the PPV calculus (error)
- [ ] change the model averaging rules (if 1M -> Pbarrier=0)
