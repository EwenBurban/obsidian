# intro
One of the major proble of the classification 'barrier'=0 or 'non-barrier'>0 is the case of loci for which the migration is close to 0 but not equal to 0. The problem is, those loci are classifi as non-barrier, so it extand the range of non-barrier and at the end, it become very hard to distinguish a barrier from a non-barrier.
In order to deal with this problem, I got an idea :â€¯add a new class , the soft-barriers
# Soft-barrier
Soft-barrier have a migration rate between \] 0 , 1\]. I consider that a loci for which $N.m > 1$ is a loci under a sufficiant rate of migration to not constitute a barrier.
