# the fours stages of speciation
1. few loci are under divergent selection. There is no apparent reproductive isolation
2. a subtential proportion, or even a great majority, of the genome remain shared and undifferentiated. Population at this stage may be calle sub_species, and they might continue to diverge or fuse depending of the ecological/geographical situation (i.e Habitat destruction or land bridge formation, for example, can facilitate such massive hybridization resulting in their fuse)
3. the diverging groups have passed the point of no return and the accumulation of speciation genes has resulted in extensively divergent (between populations) and coadapted (within population) gene complexes. Gene-sharing by introgression could persist for a long period of time and effectively retard or nullify species differentiation over some portion of the genome. Many closely related 'good species' in allopatry or sympatry are at this stage. Drosophila simulans and its two sibling species, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia, are one such example -- premating isolation is incomplete and hybrid females in F1 and subsequent generations are often fertile.
4. complete RI has evolved and the two gene pools would cease sharing alleles at any part of their genomes by means of breeding. At stage IV, premating isolation is often strong in nature and F1 hybrids of both sexes are usually inviable or sterile
