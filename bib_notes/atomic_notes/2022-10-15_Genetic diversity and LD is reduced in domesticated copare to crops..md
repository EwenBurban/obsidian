Moreover, structural variant hamper recombinaison in dom. All of this indicate change in recombinaison pattern. But, between wild and dom the recombinaison rate correlate at 0.6-0.7 ( based on window of 1Mb of recombinaison rate for each pop), showing a highly conserved recombinaison pattern between pops.
