# recombination hotspot are moved from pericentric region to the end of chromosome
Compare to wold and early domesticated population (51% and 61%) only 32% of hotspot of domesticated species are located in pericentromeric regions. It's consistant with maize data (39% of maize hotspot are un pericentromeric regions). Most of recombinaison hotspot in domesticated pop, are located in chromosomes ends. Domesticated hotspots are significantly close or within genes, which suggest these hotspot may be located in euchromatine island of accessible region of heterochromatine
