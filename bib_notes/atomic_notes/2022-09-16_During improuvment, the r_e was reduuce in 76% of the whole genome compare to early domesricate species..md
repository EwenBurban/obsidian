# During improuvment, the r_e was reduuce in 76% of the whole genome compare to early domesricate species.
This reduction is explained by the increase in inbreeding, which reduce effective recombinaison and genetic diversity. They found significant reduction of genetic diversity ( improved croos have 10-fold lower genetic diversity than wild and early domesticated )
