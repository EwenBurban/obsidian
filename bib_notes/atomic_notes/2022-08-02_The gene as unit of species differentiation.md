# The gene as unit of species differentiation
1. few loci are under divergent selection and will be the first to expose differentiation (call __speciation genes__)
2. rest of loci are neutral in all conditions and a very low level of migration between population is enough to homogeneize populations and maintain a low level of FST (called _marker loci_)
Over time and differenciation, under a parapatric model, even if at the population and individual level, differenciation build up. At the genomic levels, individuals expose a mosaic pattern of differenciation, where genomic region near speciation loci would be differentiated whearas the rest would not.
