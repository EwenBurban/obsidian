# genic view of species
peciation is the stage where the populations will not lose their divergence upon contact and, furthermore, will be able to continue to diverge.
The two central criteria are: (i) not losing the differentiation, and (ii) being able to continue to diverge
Because the rest of the genome may mix upon contact, the genomes of the diverging populations are expected to be mosaic in their extent of differentiation.
We may summarize the genic view of species as follows: species are groups that are differentially adapted and, upon contact, are not able to share genes controlling these adaptive characters, by direct exchanges or through intermediate hybrid populations. These groups may or may not be differentiated elsewhere in the genome.
