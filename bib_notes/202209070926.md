## Genetic diversity and LD is reduced in domesticated copare to crops. 
Moreover, structural variant hamper recombinaison in dom. All of this indicate change in recombinaison pattern. But, between wild and dom the recombinaison rate correlate at 0.6-0.7 ( based on window of 1Mb of recombinaison rate for each pop), showing a highly conserved recombinaison pattern between pops.

## Divergent hotspot between pop : 
a very low proprotion of hotspot is shared brtween wild and early domesticated (4-10%) and between both wild and early and the domesticated pop only 4 hotspots are shared. This expose the evolution of recombinaison pattern through domestication.  

## recombination hotspot are moved from pericentric region to the end of chromosome  
Compare to wold and early domesticated population (51% and 61%) only 32% of hotspot of domesticated species are located in pericentromeric regions. It's consistant with maize data (39% of maize hotspot are un pericentromeric regions). Most of recombinaison hotspot in domesticated pop, are located in chromosomes ends. Domesticated hotspots are significantly close or within genes, which suggest these hotspot may be located in euchromatine island of accessible region of heterochromatine  

## crossover hotspot in sweeps  
Gene with hotspot habe higher recombinaison rate and higher sweep genes rate than nonsweep genes.
